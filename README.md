# Platzi-Punks!
Platzi Punks is a web3 project in that I put all I learn about building smart contracts with the ERC721 standard. To build NFTs, in this project we create a UI to manage the smart contract, you can mint new NFTS, transfer and show your NFTs.

**NOTEðŸ’¡: The smart contract is build in the Goerli Testnet so you need to use GoerliEth to mint your Punk**
